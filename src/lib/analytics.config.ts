// variables) so a forking charity — or an automated assistant — can point the
// site at its own accounts by editing this one file.

// To use your own accounts, replace the placeholder values below with the IDs
// from each provider's dashboard. Leave a value as its placeholder to keep that
// integration effectively inert.

  // Google Analytics 4 measurement ID, e.g. 'G-ABC1234567'.
  // Intentionally left as a placeholder: this charity's GA4 property
  // (G-W8ESSNGPN7) is fired by the GTM container above (seeded on All Pages),
  // so setting it here too would load gtag.js directly AND via GTM — double-
  // counting pageviews. Leave inert unless you remove the GA4 tag from GTM.
